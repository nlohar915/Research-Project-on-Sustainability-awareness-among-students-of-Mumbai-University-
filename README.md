Awareness and Practices Related to Sustainability Among University Students

A Study Aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Overview

This research investigates university students’ awareness of sustainability concepts and their adoption of eco-friendly practices, with a particular focus on Sustainable Development Goal 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production. Conducted at the University of Mumbai, the study aims to understand the knowledge–action gap: why students may be aware of sustainability but do not consistently practice it.

Objectives

Assess Perceptions & Awareness – Evaluate students’ knowledge of eco-friendly products and sustainability concepts.

Quality, Pricing & Environmental Beliefs – Analyse the link between product attributes and willingness to support sustainable options.

Awareness to Action – Measure how environmental awareness translates into daily sustainable habits.

Resource Consumption Understanding – Assess awareness of energy conservation, waste reduction, and sustainable product use.

Methodology

Population: University students across Arts, Commerce, and Science.

Data Collection: Structured questionnaire via Google Forms.

Sample Size: 344 responses after pilot testing.

Variables: Demographics, awareness, behaviour, influencing factors, and barriers.

Statistical Techniques

Descriptive Statistics – Summarized awareness and practice patterns.

Chi-Square Tests – Tested associations between categorical variables (e.g., field of study & eco-product awareness).

Binary Logistic Regression – Predicted eco-awareness based on behavioural attitudes.

One-Way ANOVA – Compared SDG familiarity across academic disciplines.

Tools Used

Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning and visualization.

Power BI – Interactive dashboards for trends and insights.

R Programming – Statistical testing and model building.

Key Findings

Awareness is generally high, but practical adoption is inconsistent.

Students aware of eco-friendly products are significantly more willing to pay more for them.

Environmental consideration during purchases greatly increases the likelihood of awareness.

No significant difference in SDG familiarity across fields of study.

Recommendations

Integrate sustainability into curricula, increase campus-led eco-initiatives, and address cost and accessibility barriers to encourage sustainable behaviour.
